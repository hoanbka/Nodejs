What is Moment.js?

Moment.js is a free and open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object directly. The library is a wrapper for the Date object (in the same way that jQuery is a wrapper for JavaScript) making the object a whole lot easier to work with.

The problem with JavaScript’s Date object isn’t the functionality it brings; it’s just extremely cumbersome to use as a developer. If you want to do complex parsing, validation and displaying of dates, you’ll end up writing a lot of code.

Moment.js also extends native JavaScript date capabilities with a variety of features, such as relative time, calendar time, durations and multi-language support. It has a seemingly endless list of plugins that allow for additional features like time-zone support, recurrence and Twitter integration.
